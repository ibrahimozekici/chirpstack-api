# ChirpStack Kitchen API - Migration Summary

## What was changed

This project has been successfully converted from a full ChirpStack API to a kitchen-only API server.

### Files Modified

1. **Main Makefile** (`Makefile`)
   - Removed support for js, rust, python, java builds
   - Now only builds Go and Swagger targets
   - Simplified to only generate kitchen-related APIs

2. **Go Makefile** (`go/Makefile`)
   - Removed all non-kitchen protobuf generation targets
   - Now only generates `kitchen.proto`
   - Renamed target to `kitchen-api` for clarity

3. **Swagger Makefile** (`swagger/Makefile`)
   - Removed all non-kitchen swagger generation
   - Now only generates `kitchen.swagger.json`
   - Renamed target to `kitchen-api` for clarity

4. **Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.yml`)
   - Removed all language-specific services except Go and Swagger
   - Simplified to only support kitchen API generation

### Files Cleaned Up

1. **Generated Go Files**
   - Removed all `.pb.go` and `.pb.gw.go` files except kitchen-related ones
   - Removed entire directories: `ad`, `als`, `common`, `fuota`, `geo`, `gw`, `nc`, `ns`
   - Removed `as/as.pb.go` and `as/integration/` directory

2. **Generated Swagger Files**
   - Removed all `.swagger.json` files except `kitchen.swagger.json`

### Current Structure

```
protobuf/as/external/api/
├── kitchen.proto     # Kitchen API definitions
└── internal.proto    # Internal API (has dependencies, currently skipped)

go/as/external/api/
├── kitchen.pb.go     # Generated Go code for kitchen
├── kitchen.pb.gw.go  # Generated gRPC gateway for kitchen
├── internal.pb.go    # Existing internal Go code
└── internal.pb.gw.go # Existing internal gRPC gateway

swagger/as/external/api/
├── kitchen.swagger.json   # Generated Swagger for kitchen
└── internal.swagger.json  # Existing internal Swagger
```

## Build Commands

- `make all` - Builds both Go and Swagger files
- `make go` - Builds only Go protobuf files
- `make swagger` - Builds only Swagger files

## Notes

1. **Internal API**: The `internal.proto` file has dependencies on `user.proto` which was removed. Currently, only `kitchen.proto` is being generated. If you need internal API functionality, you'll need to either:
   - Create a minimal `user.proto` with just the required User message
   - Remove user-related functionality from `internal.proto`
   - Skip internal API entirely

2. **Unused Dockerfiles**: The project still contains Dockerfiles for other languages (`Dockerfile-js`, `Dockerfile-python`, etc.) which can be removed if not needed.

3. **Go Module**: The `go.mod` file still references the full module name. Consider updating if this is now a different project.

## Additional Cleanup (Optional)

If you want to clean up further:

1. Remove unused Dockerfiles:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item Dockerfile-js, Dockerfile-python, Dockerfile-rust, Dockerfile-java
   ```

2. Update the project README to reflect kitchen-only functionality

3. Consider removing or fixing `internal.proto` if not needed

## Success Verification

✅ Go build completes successfully  
✅ Swagger generation completes successfully  
✅ Only kitchen-related files are generated  
✅ Docker compose builds and runs correctly
